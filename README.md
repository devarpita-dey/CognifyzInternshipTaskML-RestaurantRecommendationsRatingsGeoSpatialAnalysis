# cognifyzInternshipTask
This repository contains the Cognifyz Internship Project on machine learning in the restaurant industry, divided into four tasks: 1) Restaurant Rating Prediction, 2) Restaurant Recommendation, 3) Cuisine Classification, and 4) Location-Based Analysis

Task 1: Restaurant Rating Prediction
In this task, I developed regression models to predict restaurant ratings based on various features such as cuisine type, location, price range, customer ratings and reviews etc. The goal was to accurately predict ratings to help users make informed dining decisions. Using regression algorithms, the model is trained on historical data and evaluated its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation
For the second task, I implemented a recommendation system that suggests restaurants to users based on their preferences. The system takes into account factors such as previous price range, user ratings, and cuisine preferences to generate personalized recommendations. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques were employed to provide users with a tailored dining experience, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

Task 3: Cuisine Classification
The third task involved building models to classify restaurants based on their cuisine types. By analyzing relevant data, the classification algorithms accurately identifies the primary cuisine of a restaurant. This classification can be useful for search and filtering functionalities, allowing users to easily find restaurants that match their culinary preferences. Various classification algorithms were explored to achieve high accuracy in identifying cuisine types.

Task 4: Location-Based Analysis
In the final task, there is location-based analysis of restaurants. This involved mapping restaurant locations and analyzing geographical trends in restaurant distribution, customer preferences, and rating patterns which city and their locality. The insights from this analysis can help in strategic decision-making for restaurant placement and marketing. Geospatial analysis techniques and visualization tools were used to provide a comprehensive overview of the spatial dynamics of the restaurant industry.
